# AFMwC-thesisProject

## About

This project is a part of my Master thesis. It contains two tools: 
- A data set generator, that creates sets of attributed feature models with context.
- A reconfigurer that attempts to find valid configurations of the models in a data set using metaheuristics.

## Installation

The project can be imported to Eclipse. In the package **no.uio.ifi.afmcrec.executionExamples** there are examples of how to run the dataset generator and the reconfigurer
